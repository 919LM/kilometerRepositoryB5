10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).

During Block 1, I completed a dice rolling game and War with Dice. The dice rolling game utilized a random number generator, and War with Dice, which I completed with another student, simulated a game of War but with dice added in. During Passion Project, I made a Discord Bot (with Aidan, the same student that I worked with on War with Dice) that is designed for our school's Discord server. This bot is able to provide moderation tools through a mute function, and entertainment tools through a function that can notify other students when one student is playing a game. There are also announcement functions built in that notify everyone automatically when an announcement is made. 




What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?

I would like to expand and improve my knowledge of other languages like C++ and HTML this year. 



What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?

The most challenging aspect of programming for me is switching languages; I have to learn the basic formats and functions all over again. 



What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.

My goal with computer programming is to have a useful skill that I can use throughout life. However, I am not yet sure whether coding will be part of my career, or just a hobby.
