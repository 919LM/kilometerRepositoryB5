10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).

During Block 1, I completed a dice rolling game and War with Dice. The dice rolling game utilized a random number generator, and War with Dice, which I completed with another student, simulated a game of War but with dice added in. During Passion Project, I made a Discord Bot (with Aidan, the same student that I worked with on War with Dice) that is designed for our school's Discord server. This bot is able to provide moderation tools through a mute function, and entertainment tools through a function that can notify other students when one student is playing a game. There are also announcement functions built in that notify everyone automatically when an announcement is made.
